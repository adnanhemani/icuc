Feature: save output from computed Zernike equation
 
  As an optometry student
  I want to be able to see the images generated from the Zernike equation
  so I can study imperfections of the eye
  
Scenario: save images as a zip file
  Given I go to the home page
  And I click "save as zip file"
  Then I should see "Successfully downloaded zip file"
